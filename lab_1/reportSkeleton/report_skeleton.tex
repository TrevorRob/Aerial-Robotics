\title{ASE 379L Laboratory 1 Report \\ Simulating Quadrotor Dynamics}
\author{Susan Burling Ward} \date{February 5, 20XX}

\maketitle
\section{Abstract} \emph{The abstract is a summary of the whole report.  Out
  of respect for our busy readers, it gets right to the point.  The first 2-3
  sentences unpack the title and motivate the report.  The remainder briefly
  offer context (if necessary) and describe the reports's method and
  main results.} \\

A high-fidelity quadrotor dynamics simulator was designed from the theory of
Newtonian dynamics and then implemented in Matlab code ...

\section{Introduction} \emph{Put here a brief introduction to the lab's
theme. Refer to relevant papers from our readings, or other papers you have
found.  This introduction need not be long: 2 paragraphs should be adequate.}\\

Quadrotor motion can be described by a combination of linear and attitude
dynamics and certain linear motion and attitude kinematics relationships.  The
governing equations for a simplified simulator can be found in
\cite{mellinger2012trajectory}.  However, a high-fidelity simulator must
account for effects that \cite{mellinger2012trajectory} ignores ...

\section{Theoretical Development} \emph{Put here any theoretical development (e.g.,
modeling) required to answer the boxed questions posed in the lab assignment.
Then proceed to answer the theoretical boxed questions from the lab---those
that do no depend on experimental results.}

\section{Implementation} \emph{Describe here your basic implementation strategy and
any non-obvious implementation aspects.  Include snippets of your code
here to illustrate its features.  Put the complete code in an Appendix to the
lab report.}

\section{Results and Analysis}
\emph{Perform all tests and experiments requested by the lab, and analyze the
  results of these experiments. Answer any remaining boxed questions that were
  not answered in the Theoretical Development section.}\\

The {\tt simulateQuadrotorDynamics} function was run on the three input
structures {\tt Stest} provided.  The simulated attitude and position of the
quad for each of these is shown in Figs. \ref{fig:sca} and
\ref{fig:utdata}. ...

\emph{Further analyze the results here.}

\section{Conclusion}
\emph{Much like the abstract, the Conclusion summarizes the most important
  results of the report.  It should be fairly short (one paragraph) and to the
  point.} \\

An open-loop control strategy was developed to generate the rotor
angular rates required to cause the simulated quadcopter to fly in a complete
circle on a horizontal plane.  The strategy was based on ...
